# Next steps

- Allow for input sniffing, i.e. determine if input binary is a raw drive dump or raw MFT dump
- Add test suite raw volume binary

# Backlog
- Fix color on regular CMD terminal
- Documentation
  - Track subitems here
- Fix example for directory aggregation, make FILENAME entries the major point of iteration
  - Work out how to represent hard links in this scheme (i.e. only count them once)
